Maven is a build automation tool primarily used for java projects.In software development,"Build" is a process of creating a final application in the form of executables or binaries
by combining and compiling all the required source code.Build process for a  simple peice of code like a "hello world!" would not be complicated but in the case of huge projects there
might be several dependencies and plugins required to make an executable.In such cases , a set of instructions to add the plugins and dependencies required must be given during build automation.
Maven takes this information from pom.xml file.
Therefore to use maven for build automation pom.xml file is required.

SETTING UP MAVEN ON JENKINS:
STEP 1:
INSTALL JDK:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

STEP 4:
Get back to jenkins default dashboard
click on "New Item"
enter a name for the project.

click "ok"

STEP 5:
configure the project:
in Source code management,
choose git.

for understanding purposes ,you can use "https://github.com/itcuties/Axis-2-client.git"

in Build,
enter Root POM(path of pom.xml file)
the above mentioned git repo has pom.xml in "HighScoresServiceClient/pom.xml"

enter Goals and options as "compile"
